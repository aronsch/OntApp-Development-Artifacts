# Artificats from Ontological Requirements Management Application 

Project artifacts from an application I freelanced on part-time from 2014-2018. 
* Proprietary content I did not author has been removed, mostly involving domain-specific ontologies, a Java-based NLP layer and the Parliament triple store. I did direct some of the API features for the NLP layer sitting between the client-facing web server and the triple store, but did not develop it directly.
* I also managed issue tracking and pull requests, as well as flogging everyone to actually use git and the dev environment.
* Angular code is here: [/webserver/mean/public](webserver/mean/public)
* Core Node/Express code is here: [/webserver/mean/public](webserver/mean/app)
